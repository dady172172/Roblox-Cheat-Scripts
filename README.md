# Roblox-Cheats
Scripts that have GUI in there name, mean that they have an interface in game (Buttons and Dropdowns). The scripts that do not have GUI in the name require a Global variable to be turned on and off.
I provide a game link at the top of every script, so there is no confusion about which game the script is for.
The scripts in "Others" is just some scripts that other people have made that I have found usefull.
The scripts in "Tools" are the tools that I used to make most of these scripts.
Some scripts may have special instruction at the top. So make sure to read any special instructions.

# FAQ
-   Q:Are payed injectors better than the free ones?
    A:Yes, but keep in mind some smaller scripts don't require the features of a paid injector.

    A:You can get banned if they find you in violation of Robloxes [TOS](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use). Injecting the game can get you banned. So please use common sense when using scripts/injectors. If you don't RAGE HACK, you should be ok.

    A:Please check and make sure that the script is for the game you are playing. By opening the link at the top of the script. Where it says "Game : https:....". This link provides the exact game the script was made for. If it is for your game then please report it here on GitHub.
